## Security Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All generated files must follow security rules:

@docs/security/SECURITY-RULES.md

**Key requirements:**
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use placeholders: `your_service_key_here`
- Protect `.env` files with `.gitignore`
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders only
- Document key acquisition for users

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

Goal: Add MCP protocol components to an existing FastMCP server. Supports tools, resources, prompts, middleware, context management, dependencies, and elicitation.

Core Principles:
- Ask which component type to add
- Support multiple components in one invocation
- Follow FastMCP SDK patterns from documentation
- Use proper decorators and type hints

Phase 1: Discovery
Goal: Understand which components to add

Actions:
- Parse $ARGUMENTS for component type and server path
- Use AskUserQuestion to gather:
  - Which components to add (can select multiple):
    - Tools (@mcp.tool() - executable functions)
    - Resources (@mcp.resource() - data access with URI templates)
    - Prompts (@mcp.prompt() - LLM interaction templates)
    - Middleware (logging, caching, error handling, timing)
    - Context (server context management)
    - Dependencies (dependency injection)
    - Elicitation (user input from server)
  - Server file location (if not provided)
  - For each selected component, ask specific details:
    - Tools: Function name, parameters, return type, description
    - Resources: URI template, data source, caching strategy
    - Prompts: Template name, variables, use case
    - Middleware: Type (logging, caching, error, timing, custom)
    - Context: State management needs
    - Dependencies: Services to inject
- Load FastMCP documentation:
  @plugins/fastmcp/docs/fastmcp-documentation.md

Phase 2: Analysis
Goal: Understand existing server structure

Actions:
- Find server file (server.py, main.py, src/server.ts, src/index.ts)
- Read existing code to understand:
  - Current language (Python or TypeScript)
  - Existing components
  - Import patterns
  - Code style
- Identify where to add new components
- Check for conflicts with existing names

Phase 3: Implementation
Goal: Add selected components

Actions:

Determine complexity:
- Count total components to add
- If adding 10 or fewer components: Implement directly (no agent needed)
- If adding 11-50 components: Optionally use Task with general-purpose agent
- If adding 50+ components OR wrapping API endpoints: Use Task with general-purpose agent

For simple cases (<=10 components), implement directly:
- WebFetch relevant documentation based on component type:
  - Tools: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools
  - Resources: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources
  - Prompts: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/prompts
  - Middleware: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/middleware
  - Context: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/context
  - Dependencies: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/dependencies
  - Elicitation: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/elicitation
- Read existing server code
- Add component following fetched documentation patterns
- Use Edit tool to add imports and component code
- Add proper type hints/annotations (Python) or TypeScript types
- Include comprehensive docstrings/comments
- Add error handling
- Follow existing code style

For complex cases (>50 components), use Task tool NOW:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Add MCP components to FastMCP server",
  prompt="Add {count} MCP components to FastMCP server at {server-path}.

**Component Specifications:** {specs from Phase 1}
**Server Language:** {detected-language}
**Target File:** {server-file-path}
- Expected output: Component(s) added to server

Phase 4: Verification
Goal: Verify components work

Actions:
- Run syntax check based on language:
  - Python: `python -m py_compile <file>`
  - TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Verify imports are correct
- Check that server can start
- Display added components summary

Phase 5: Summary
Goal: Show what was added and next steps

Actions:
- List all components added with their signatures
- Show how to test each component:
  - Tools: How to call from client
  - Resources: URI pattern to access
  - Prompts: How to use in LLM interactions
  - Middleware: Execution order and effects
- Suggest next steps:
  - Add authentication if handling sensitive data
  - Configure deployment for production
  - Add testing for new components
  - Consider adding related components
