🚨 **EXECUTION NOTICE FOR CLAUDE**

When you invoke this command via SlashCommand, the system returns THESE INSTRUCTIONS below.

**YOU are the executor. This is NOT an autonomous subprocess.**

- ✅ The phases below are YOUR execution checklist
- ✅ YOU must run each phase immediately using tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, TodoWrite)
- ✅ Complete ALL phases before considering this command done
- ❌ DON't wait for "the command to complete" - YOU complete it by executing the phases
- ❌ DON't treat this as status output - it IS your instruction set

**Immediately after SlashCommand returns, start executing Phase 0, then Phase 1, etc.**

See `@CLAUDE.md` section "SlashCommand Execution - YOU Are The Executor" for detailed explanation.

## Security Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All generated files must follow security rules:

@docs/security/SECURITY-RULES.md

**Key requirements:**
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use placeholders: `your_service_key_here`
- Protect `.env` files with `.gitignore`
- Create `.env.example` with placeholders only
- Document key acquisition for users

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

Goal: Add authentication and authorization to an existing FastMCP server. Supports OAuth 2.1 (all providers), JWT token verification, Bearer tokens, and authorization middleware.

Core Principles:
- Ask which authentication method to use
- Support all OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Azure, WorkOS, Auth0, AWS Cognito, Descope, Scalekit, Supabase)
- Handle both server-side and remote OAuth
- Secure credential management
- Follow FastMCP auth patterns

Phase 1: Discovery
Goal: Understand authentication requirements

Actions:
- Parse $ARGUMENTS for auth type and server path
- Use AskUserQuestion to gather:
  - Authentication method:
    - OAuth 2.1 Providers (select which):
      - Google
      - GitHub
      - Azure (Microsoft Entra)
      - WorkOS / AuthKit
      - Auth0
      - AWS Cognito
      - Descope
      - Scalekit
      - Supabase
    - JWT Token Verification
    - Bearer Token
    - Remote OAuth (proxy)
  - OAuth configuration (if OAuth selected):
    - Client ID source (env variable name)
    - Client secret source (env variable name)
    - Scopes needed
    - Redirect URI
    - Token storage strategy
  - JWT configuration (if JWT selected):
    - JWT secret source
    - Token location (header, cookie)
    - Claims to validate
    - Issuer/audience validation
  - Bearer token configuration (if Bearer selected):
    - Token storage method (env, file, database)
    - Token format
  - Server file location
- Load FastMCP auth documentation:
  @plugins/fastmcp/docs/fastmcp-documentation.md

Phase 2: Analysis
Goal: Understand existing server and language

Actions:
- Find server file
- Read existing code to determine:
  - Language (Python or TypeScript)
  - Existing authentication (if any)
  - Import patterns
  - Middleware configuration
- Check for conflicts with existing auth

Phase 3: Implementation
Goal: Add authentication

Actions:

**Use Task tool NOW to implement authentication:**

```
Task(
  subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Add authentication to FastMCP server", prompt="Add {auth-type} authentication to FastMCP server at {server-path}.

**Authentication Type:** {selected-auth-type}
**Server Language:** {detected-language}
**Configuration:** {auth-config from Phase 1}

    - GitHub: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github
    - Azure: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure

    - Descope: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/descope
    - Scalekit: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit
- Add provider-specific imports
- Configure provider with credentials from environment
- Add authentication middleware to server
- Update .env.example with required variables
- Add redirect URI configuration (for OAuth)
- Include error handling for auth failures
- Add authorization middleware if requested:
  - Permit.io: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/permit
  - Eunomia: https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/eunomia-authorization

Provide the agent with:
- Context: Auth method and configuration from Phase 1
- Target: Server file path
- Language: Python or TypeScript
- Expected output: Authentication configured and working

Phase 4: Configuration Files
Goal: Update environment and documentation

Actions:
- Ensure .env.example has all required variables:
  - OAuth: CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI
  - JWT: JWT_SECRET, JWT_ISSUER, JWT_AUDIENCE
  - Bearer: BEARER_TOKEN or token file path
- Add .gitignore entry for .env if missing
- Update README with:
  - How to get OAuth credentials
  - Environment variables needed
  - Authentication flow explanation
  - Testing instructions

Phase 5: Verification
Goal: Verify authentication works

Actions:
- Run syntax check
- Verify imports are correct
- Check .env.example is complete
- Verify .env is in .gitignore
- Scan for hardcoded credentials (should be none)

Phase 6: Summary
Goal: Show configuration and next steps

Actions:
- Display authentication setup
- Show .env variables needed
- Explain how to obtain credentials:
  - Google: https://console.cloud.google.com
  - GitHub: https://github.com/settings/developers
  - Azure: https://portal.azure.com
  - WorkOS: https://workos.com
  - Auth0: https://auth0.com
  - AWS Cognito: https://aws.amazon.com/cognito
  - Descope: https://app.descope.com
  - Scalekit: https://app.scalekit.com
- Provide testing examples
- Suggest adding authorization if needed (Permit.io, Eunomia)
